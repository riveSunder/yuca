## _Hydrogeminium natans_ and s613 share the same neighborhood kernel, and the s613 persistence function is placed nearly in the same position as the _'Geminium_ growth function. 

## The behavior is very different. Is it the CA framework? Isn't it at least as likely to be a result of the diffferent selection strategy for rule parameters? 

## Lenia CA and patterns were mostly manually engineered or selected for human preferences [^Ch2019]. Most glaberish CA were selected specifically for halting (vanishing) proportion (50/50) or unpredictability [^Da2022]. 

## Note that Lenia CA _Astrium scintillans_ and two variants of _Pentafolium incarceratus_ have a more dynamic character. Check them here: [https://chakazul.github.io/Lenia/JavaScript/Lenia.html](https://chakazul.github.io/Lenia/JavaScript/Lenia.html)
