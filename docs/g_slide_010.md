# Spatial entropy over time

## s613 demonstrates greater spatial entropy variation over time compared to _Hydrogeminium natans_

## _Hydrogeminium natans_ and s613 share the same neighborhood kernel, and the s613 persistence function is placed nearly in the same position as the _'Geminium_ growth function. 

## The behavior is very different. But isn't it more likely that how the rule parameters were selected has more to do with the difference in dynamics? 

## Lenia CA and patterns were mostly manually engineered or selected for human preferences. Most glaberish CA were selected specifically for halting (vanishing) proportion (50/50) or unpredictability. 

## Note that Lenia CA _Astrium scintillans_ and two variants of _Pentafolium incarceratus_ have a more dynamic character.
