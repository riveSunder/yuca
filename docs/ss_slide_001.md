# Conclusions

## * Given the common form continuous cellular automata (CA) dynamics and numerical methods for differential equations, we might intuitively expect by decreasing step size we can improve the stability of CA patterns toward some ideal, analytical version of the pattern.

## * We'd be wrong! CA patterns are not generally more stable/accuracte at lower step size; instead they occupy specific ranges and a step size too small can be as catastrophic as on that is too large.

## * Qualitative differences in behavior also become apparent at different step sizes for some patterns.
