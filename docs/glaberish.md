Gliders in <em>Hydrogeminium natans</em> (Left, Lenia) and s613 (Right, in Glaberish, a variant of Lenia). The fast/wobbly gliders have similar behavior but different cell state values. This animation corresponds to Figure 11 in the paper.

Three cellular automata rollouts for s613 (left) and <em>Hydrogeminium natans</em>, 155 time steps with 'typical' (random uniform) initial grid states. Grids start out with the same states, and this animation supports Figure 9 in the paper.
