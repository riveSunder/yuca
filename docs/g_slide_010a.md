# How do typical Glaberish and Lenia CA compare (spatial entropy)?

## Glaberish s613 CA compared to Lenia _Hydrogeminium natans_ CA in terms of spatial entropy maps.

### Left column shows the initial state (a), _Hydrogeminium_ after 512 time steps (c) s613 after 512 time steps (e). Right columns shows the corresponding spatial entropy maps for initial state (b), _Hydrogeminium_ (d), and s613 (f). In [^Wu1999] high entropy variance is noted as a hallmark of complexity in 1D CA, which is what we see here in s613.
