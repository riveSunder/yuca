# Conclusions 

### Lenia Continuous Cellular Automata Framework does not have easy implementations for Life-like CA that have distinct *B*irth and *S*urvival rules. 

### We can "rescue" the ability to easily implement these CA with a new variant of Lenia called Glaberish; as a framework Glaberish is about twice as complicated. Life-like CA easily implemented in Glaberish but not in Lenia include Morley (B368/S245) and the optimal complexity CA, Dynamic Life (BS356/S23) from Peña and Sayama [^Pe2021].

### The dynamics of Glaberish CA I have worked with are different from Lenia, but I suspect this has more to do with the selection strategy used to evolve CA rules than the structure of the framework itself.
