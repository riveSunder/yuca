# Conclusions 

### * The Lenia Continuous Cellular Automata Framework does not have easy implementations for Life-like CA that have distinct *B*irth and *S*urvival rules. 

### * We can rescue the ability to easily implement these CA with a new variant of Lenia called glaberish; as a framework glaberish is about twice as complicated. Life-like CA easily implemented in glaberish but not in Lenia include Morley (B368/S245) and the optimal complexity CA, Dynamic Life (B356/S23) from (Peña and Sayama 2021) [^Pe2021].

### * The dynamics of glaberish CA I have worked with are different from Lenia, but I suspect this has more to do with the selection strategy used to evolve CA rules than the structure of the framework itself.
