# We should consider step size when exploring CA patterns

## * Rather than a simple tradeoff between accuracy and computational time, specific step sizes pair with particular patterns and their ability to organize themselves

## * We should probably consider step size as an optimizable and explorable parameter when developing new experiments in continuous and neural CA, and other dynamic systems supporting self-organizing behavior.
