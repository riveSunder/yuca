# ... We can implement Morley by splitting the growth function

## Instead of a single growth function, we use two functions: genesis and persistence, conditioned on the current cell value

## This allows non-overlapping updates

## With growth split into genesis and persistence, glaberish recovers the ability to implement Morley and others.
