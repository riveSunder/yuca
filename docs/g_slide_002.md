# Why make complex things more complicated?

### _i.e._ is it worth the effort? 

### Glaberish can implement CA like Morley and Dynamic Life more easily than Lenia, but both frameworks are computationally universal. While it may be tedious, you can at least implement any Life-like CA by first implementing Life and then building a metaixel (aka metacell).

### Of course, the same question can be asked of Lenia, SmoothLife, Larger-than-Life, and even anything more complicated to implement than the elementary cellular automata rule 110, the simplest universal CA I've heard of [^Co2004].  

### One answer that I like to think about is the potential for artificial agents that learn and navigate obstacles in a physicaly consistent universe. Early work from [Hamon and others](https://developmentalsystems.org/sensorimotor-lenia) gives us a glimpse.
